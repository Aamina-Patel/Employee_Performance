# Employee_Performance

## Introduction
In this challenge, I worked as a HR data analyst to analyse workforce patterns and uncover actionable insights that HR teams and business leaders can use to improve employee satisfaction, optimise performance, and enhance organisational effectiveness.


## About the Dataset
The dataset I explored resembled a professional HR management system, and included attributes and metrics such as:
-	Employee demographics, education level, job roles, and organisational hierarchy
-	Performance ratings, training hours, overtime, absenteeism, and engagement metrics
-	Compensation data including salaries, bonuses, and benefits costs
-	Manager relationships, promotion flags, and career progression indicators
-	Store locations, departments, employment types, and business outcomes
-	Monthly performance tracking across 3 years (2022-2024)
-	Role-specific KPIs, productivity indices, and customer satisfaction scores


## Problem Statement
My task is to analyse this comprehensive dataset of over 497,000 detailed employee performance records to help organisations identify top-performing employees and departments, evaluate compensation effectiveness, assess manager performance and team dynamics, discover 
patterns in employee satisfaction and retention, and provide recommendations to improve workforce productivity and organisational culture.


## My Approach and Tools Used
To create this dashboard I used PowerBI and PowerPoint, ensuring accuracy and interactivity. As the data was clean, I got straight into data analysis in PowerBI.


### Data Analysis

#### 1. Creating measures: 
- Created 7 measures for KPI's and created a measures table for easy access 

#### 2. Creating visuals: 
- Created visuals and KPI's (4) for each page, ensuring there were at least 2 ZoomCharts drill down visuals on each page 

#### 3. Layout & Interactivity: 
- Created background in PowerPoint and inserted into PowerBI via canvas background settings. Then inserted page navigator, buttons to navigate bookmarks and images to link to LinkedIn and GitHub 
  
### Final Dashboard




## Conclusion & Recommendations

#### Key Takeaways
- Sales have been higher than targets but sales fell between 2023 and 2024 with New York stores generating the highest revenue
- Most satisfied department is store operations and the least satisfied department is marketing
- Top performing employees are typically between 25 - 30 years old
- More time spent training doesn't mean higher performance rating - the highest performance rating came from employees who trained for 2 hours

#### Recommendations
- To increase revenue they could expand their top performing stores
- Improve least satisfied departments through team building days and increasing employee engagement
- Keep top performing employees motivated through bonus incentives and raises
- Improvements need to be made to training to improve employee performance and keep employees engaged so they use and benefit from it, for example, by using a leaderboard
